# arcohol-rpi

NodeJS Raspberry PI server/client to highlight wine pairings based on food choices. The raspberry Pi lights up LEDs which highlight paired wine bottles. Food choices are received from a [connected iPad app](https://github.com/ribot/arcohol-ios). This is based on a concept originally conceived by Tesco Labs and ribot.
